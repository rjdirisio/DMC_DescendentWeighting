# DMC_DescendentWeighting
A Diffusion Monte Carlo Code for the Quantum Mechanical Harmonic Oscillator Model.  This approach defines each delta function, or 'walker', as its own object, which is not super efficient.

This code runs through the Diffusion Monte Carlo Algorithm with a random walk for 1000 timesteps, meaning this is not based on any sort of convergence criteria.
